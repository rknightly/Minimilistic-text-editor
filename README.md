Minimilistic text editor
---
A simple text editor built in Python with the tkinter library! This text editor is for people who want a minimilistic text editor without debuggers, intellisense, or any other destracting and annoying features. However the text editor still allows the user to edit options such as tab space and keywords for syntax highlighting. The text editor uses the scrolled text widget from tkinter in order for the user to write code. If you would like to know more about how to use my text editor read the manual.txt file in the src folder.
